Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard

Project Overview:
This Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard project is designed to enhance business operations through sophisticated data visualization and analysis. Developed using MySQL and Power BI, this dashboard serves as a vital tool for coffee shop management by providing real-time insights into various performance metrics.

Key Features and Learnings:

Data Integration:

MySQL: Utilized MySQL to efficiently store and manage large datasets related to sales, inventory, and customer information. This involved creating and managing databases, writing complex queries for data extraction, and ensuring data integrity and security.
Power BI: Leveraged Power BI to connect to MySQL databases, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive visualizations. Learned how to import data, create relationships between tables, and use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for advanced calculations and metrics.
Sales Trends Analysis:

Developed visualizations to track daily, weekly, and monthly sales trends. Implemented time-series analysis to identify peak sales periods and understand customer purchasing behavior. This involved using Power BI's time intelligence functions and creating custom measures to analyze trends.
Inventory Management:

Created dashboards to monitor inventory levels, track stock movements, and predict future inventory needs. Applied Power BIâ€™s forecasting features and conditional formatting to highlight critical inventory levels and optimize stock management.
Customer Demographics:

Built visualizations to analyze customer demographics, including age, gender, and purchase patterns. Used Power BI to segment data and create demographic reports, helping the business tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.
Strategic Decision-Making:

Enabled data-driven decision-making by providing actionable insights through interactive dashboards. Implemented filters and slicers to allow users to drill down into specific data segments and generate customized reports.
